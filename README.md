**Enigma2 project**  

**APOD Plugin E2** – displays **NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day**.  
Supports daily images from NASA: [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/)

### **How to Use the NASA API Key for the APOD Plugin** 🚀
#### **1. Obtain the NASA API Key** 🌌
To access the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) data from NASA, you need a valid API key.

* Visit the NASA API registration page:
  `https://api.nasa.gov/`

* After completing the registration, you will receive a unique API key that grants access to the data.
---

#### **2. Adding the API Key to Your System** 🔑
Once you have the API key, store it securely on your system.

##### **Method 1: Create a file for the API Key** 📂
Run this command in your terminal to create the file:

```bash
echo "YOUR_NASA_API_KEY" > /etc/apod_api_key
```

Set proper permissions so only the owner can read/write:

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/apod_api_key
```

Make sure the file is accessible and secure.

---

#### **3. Restart the System to Apply Changes** 🔄
After saving the API key, restart the plugin or GUI so the key can be loaded correctly.

---

#### **4. Troubleshooting** ⚠️
* **Invalid API Key Error**: Check the contents of your key file and ensure the key is copied exactly as provided.
* **Permission Issues**: Ensure the key file has the correct permissions (`chmod 600`).
* **Missing File**: Make sure the key exists in one of the expected paths.
---
Once done, the plugin should be able to access NASA's APOD data and display the Astronomy Picture of the Day properly. ✨
