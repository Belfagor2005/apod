### **How to Use the NASA API Key for the APOD Plugin** üöÄ
#### **1. Obtain the NASA API Key** üåå
To access the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) data from NASA, you need a valid API key.

* Visit the NASA API registration page:
  `https://api.nasa.gov/`

* After completing the registration, you will receive a unique API key that grants access to the data.
---

#### **2. Adding the API Key to Your System** üîë
Once you have the API key, store it securely on your system.

##### **Method 1: Create a file for the API Key** üìÇ
Run this command in your terminal to create the file:

```bash
echo "YOUR_NASA_API_KEY" > /etc/apod_api_key
```

Set proper permissions so only the owner can read/write:

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/apod_api_key
```

Make sure the file is accessible and secure.

---

#### **3. Restart the System to Apply Changes** üîÑ
After saving the API key, restart the plugin or GUI so the key can be loaded correctly.

---

#### **4. Troubleshooting** ‚ö†Ô∏è
* **Invalid API Key Error**: Check the contents of your key file and ensure the key is copied exactly as provided.
* **Permission Issues**: Ensure the key file has the correct permissions (`chmod 600`).
* **Missing File**: Make sure the key exists in one of the expected paths.
---
Once done, the plugin should be able to access NASA's APOD data and display the Astronomy Picture of the Day properly. ‚ú®
